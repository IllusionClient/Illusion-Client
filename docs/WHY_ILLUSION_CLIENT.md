**A next‑generation performance & PvP client engineered for Minecraft 1.21.11**

## 📌 Overview

Illusion Client is **not** a modpack, preset, or template.  
It is a **fully engineered Fabric client** built for players who take PvP seriously — with real engine‑level optimizations, real mixins, real UI code, and real anti‑tamper protection.

Where other clients flip a few settings, Illusion Client modifies the **actual game engine** and UI pipeline to deliver measurable, repeatable improvements you can feel in combat.

---

## ⚡ Engine‑Level Performance (Real Optimizations)

Illusion Client implements **real engine changes**, not placebo toggles.

### ✔ ParticleEngineMixin  
Caps particle creation at runtime → **instant GPU relief**.

### ✔ LevelRendererMixin (Entity Culling)  
Skips rendering entities outside the frustum → **real FPS gains** in crowded areas.

### ✔ GameRendererMixin (Fullbright)  
Overrides gamma at the engine level → **clean, stable fullbright**.

### ✔ FpsBoostModule  
Writes directly to Minecraft’s internal options API for 1.21.11:
- Clouds  
- Shadows  
- Smooth lighting  
- Particle mode  
- Lighting engine toggles

These are **engine calls**, not UI tricks.

## 🎯 PvP Modules Built in Real Java

Every PvP feature is a real class with real logic — not a preset or overlay.

- CPS Counter  
- Keystrokes HUD  
- Armour Durability  
- Potion Timer  
- Reach Display  
- Sprint Toggle  
- Combo Counter (event‑driven)  
- Hit Flash (mixin‑based)

Modules read **live game values** and update in real time.

---

## 🎨 A Custom UI Framework (Not a Template)

Illusion Client ships a hand‑coded UI system with production polish:

- Animated Right‑Shift menu  
- Violet active‑tab underline  
- Lerp‑animated toggle pills  
- Hover highlights  
- Smooth open animation (scale + alpha)  
- Updated drawText usage for 1.21.11  
- Full settings architecture (IllusionConfig)

It looks and feels like a native client UI, not a copied template.

---

## 🧠 Smart Configuration System

- **Gson‑backed config** stored in `.minecraft/illusion/`  
- Auto‑save on every toggle  
- Per‑module settings and profiles  
- Real‑time updates — no restart required

This behaves like a proper application configuration system.

---

## 🛡️ Anti‑Copying Protection (Real IP Protection)

Illusion Client includes multiple protection layers to protect your compiled builds:

### 🔐 ProGuard Obfuscation  
Class and method names are obfuscated; line numbers removed.

### 🔑 XOR String Encryption  
Visible strings are stored encrypted and decoded at runtime.

### 🧬 Cryptographic Watermark  
Each build contains a SHA‑256 fingerprint tied to your private seed and build metadata so you can prove ownership.

These measures protect the distributed JAR from trivial copying and decompilation.

---
