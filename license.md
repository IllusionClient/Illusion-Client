## 4. PROHIBITED ACTIONS

The following actions are **strictly prohibited** without prior written consent from IllusionDev:

- Copying or duplicating any part of the source code
- Decompiling, disassembling, or reverse engineering the compiled JAR
- Using decompiled or reverse-engineered code in any form
- Creating derivative works, including forks, ports, or modified versions
- Distributing, selling, or sublicensing the Software
- Removing, disabling, or bypassing the watermark or protection systems

- Circumventing technical protection measures (TPMs)
- Uploading the Software to public mod repositories without permission
- Using the Software on public servers or commercial game servers

**Any violation of these terms constitutes copyright infringement and may result in legal action, injunctions, and statutory damages.**

---

---

## 6. TECHNICAL PROTECTION MEASURES (TPMs)

IllusionClient includes multiple technical protection measures designed to prevent unauthorized copying and modification:

### 6.1 Cryptographic Watermark

Each build contains a unique SHA-256 fingerprint that:
- Survives decompilation and repacking
- Identifies the exact build version and release date
- Is verified against known legitimate builds
- Triggers warnings if tampering is detected

### 6.2 String Encryption

- All string constants are XOR-encrypted using a multi-fragment private key
- Encryption prevents static analysis of code functionality
- Keys are distributed in a manner that prevents extraction

### 6.3 ProGuard Obfuscation

- The compiled JAR is heavily obfuscated to prevent reverse engineering
- Method names, class names, and variable names are scrambled
- Control flow is modified to prevent analysis
- Obfuscation rules are proprietary and not disclosed

### 6.4 Anti-Tampering Detection

- The Software verifies its own integrity on startup
- Modified or repacked JARs are detected and flagged
- Unauthorized modifications may trigger safeguards

**DMCA Compliance:** Circumventing, disabling, or attempting to bypass any TPM is a separate and independent legal violation under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 1201, with penalties of $200–$2,500 per work, regardless of whether copyright infringement occurs.
