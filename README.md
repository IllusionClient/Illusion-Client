## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### ❌ Client won't launch

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check Java version
java -version

# Should output Java 17 or higher. If not installed:
# Windows: Download from oracle.com/java
# macOS: brew install java
# Linux: sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk
```

**If that doesn't work:**
1. Delete the config folder: `.minecraft/illusion/`
2. Restart the client
3. Reconfigure your settings

#### ❌ FPS not improving

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Are you using the "Competitive" preset?
- [ ] Is fancy graphics **OFF**?
- [ ] Is render distance ≤ 8 chunks?
- [ ] Are animations disabled (press **RIGHT SHIFT**)?
- [ ] Close unnecessary background programs (Discord, Chrome, etc.)

**Advanced troubleshooting:**
- Increase Java heap size: Set `_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx4G` environment variable
- Update GPU drivers to latest version
- Verify Minecraft 1.21.11 is installed (not another version)

#### ❌ Animations causing lag

**Solution:**
1. Press **RIGHT SHIFT** to instantly disable animations
2. Or go to Settings → UI → Toggle Animations OFF
3. Changes take effect immediately (no restart needed)

#### ❌ Game crashes on startup

**Step 1:** Update Java
```bash
# Download Java 21 from oracle.com
# Or: brew install java (macOS) / sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk (Linux)
```

**Step 2:** Clear cache
```bash
# Delete temporary files
rm -rf ~/.minecraft/illusion/cache/
```

**Step 3:** Verify Minecraft version
- Open Minecraft Launcher → Installations
- Confirm you're on version 1.21.11

**Step 4:** Increase allocated memory
- Minecraft Launcher → Installations → Edit
- Under JVM Arguments, set `-Xmx4G -Xms2G`
- Click Save

#### ❌ Connection/Lag issues

These are **server-side**, not client issues. Try:
- Connect to a different server to confirm
- Check your internet connection: `ping 8.8.8.8`
- Restart your router
- Check if the server is lagging for other players

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is Illusion Client allowed on my favorite server?**  
A: Check your server's rules! Illusion Client is allowed on most survival/PvP servers, but some have restrictions. Always verify before installing.

**Q: Will this get me banned?**  
A: Not on servers that allow modded clients. Illusion Client doesn't cheat—it just optimizes performance. Always check server rules.

**Q: How much RAM should I allocate?**  
A: 
- Minimum: 2GB
- Recommended: 4GB
- Competitive play: 6-8GB

See [Minecraft RAM allocation guide](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms/windows-realm) for instructions.

**Q: Can I use this on servers like Hypixel?**  
A: No. Hypixel and similar networks ban modded clients. Use vanilla Minecraft on restricted servers.

**Q: Why is my FPS still low?**  
A: Common causes:
1. GPU drivers are outdated → Update drivers
2. Render distance too high → Lower to 6-8 chunks
3. Background programs consuming resources → Close them
4. Java version too old → Update to Java 21
5. Not using Competitive preset → Switch presets

**Q: Can I customize the UI colors?**  
A: Yes! Edit `.minecraft/illusion/config.json` and modify the `ui.colors` section. Restart the client to apply changes.

**Q: Is there a Linux version?**  
A: Yes! Download the Linux `.tar.gz` from Releases and follow the [Linux Installation Guide](#step-2-extract--install).

**Q: How do I uninstall?**  
A: Simply delete the Illusion Client folder. Your Minecraft installation remains untouched.

**Q: Can I use Illusion Client with other mods?**  
A: Not recommended. Illusion Client is designed as a standalone client. Using mods may cause incompatibilities.

**Q: How often are updates released?**  
A: We aim for updates monthly. Critical bug fixes may be released sooner.
